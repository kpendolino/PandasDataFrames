DataFrames allow you to read, sort, manipulate, and display data. In this exercise, you'll create your first DataFrame and use it to do some initial exploration of a data set.\n\n## Objectives\n\nWhen you finish this lab, you should be comfortable with:\n\n- Loading data into a DataFrame from a CSV file\n- Printing out the first or last five rows\n- Viewing DataFrame attributes like its columns and shape\n- Accessing individual columns\n- Manipulating the data set including sorting, ranking, grouping\n- Adding new columns and populating them with generated data\n- Changing the data type of a column\n- Filtering data by column values using `loc` and numerical or qualitative values\n\nWe'll build on these further in the next lab.\n\n## Resources\n\n### Exercise Files\n\nYou can use right-click + \"save link as\" to download these files.

We'll use the _min_ ranking method; this means that records with the same value will all share the rank on the lower end of the tied range - if three records are tied for second place, they will all receive rank 2, and the next record will start at rank 5.

To save results as a new column, use square brackets - just as you would to add a new element to a dictionary.","metadata":{},"id":"8f9135fd-15d3-4a23-9665-76a4b9a2b88e"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# EXAMPLE CODE \n# Sort the rows by Rating, then print the best five\nprint(chips.sort_values(RATING,ascending=False).head())","metadata":{},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"              Company                Flavor   Style  Rating  Overall Rank\n94           Cape Cod  Sour Cream and Onion  Kettle   9.525           1.0\n24             Kettle  Sour Cream and Onion  Kettle   9.455           2.0\n17          Old Dutch  Sour Cream and Onion  Kettle   9.415           3.0\n23             Kettle       Salt and Pepper  Kettle   9.343           4.0\n159  Jay's of Chicago  Sour Cream and Onion  Ridges   8.874           5.0\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"0f3193e1-94e4-43ef-8b4c-8118bc94aa2c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# EXAMPLE CODE \n# Calculate overall rankings\nchips[OVERALLRANK]=chips[RATING].rank(method=\"min\",ascending=False)\n\nprint(chips[[COMPANY,STYLE,FLAVOR,OVERALLRANK]].head())","metadata":{},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"     Company    Style     Flavor  Overall Rank\n0  Old Dutch  Regular      Plain          74.0\n1  Old Dutch   Kettle      Plain         105.0\n2  Old Dutch   Canned      Plain         116.0\n3  Old Dutch   Ridges      Plain         143.0\n4  Old Dutch  Regular  Bar-B-Que          51.0\n","output_type":"stream"}],"id":"72cd84f7-2e72-4d09-b5eb-48220f5bcdff"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Print the first five rows of `chocolate` after sorting by _Rating_, descending.\n\n> Add a new column to `chocolate` using the `OVERALLRANK` constant as the label.
